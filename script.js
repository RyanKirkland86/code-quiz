//When you click the START button, a timer starts and you are presented with a question



//When you answer the question, you are presented with another question



//When you answer incorrectly, then time is subrtracted from the clock (something like 10 sec?)



/* When you answer all questions the timer will stop 
OR IF the timer reaches 0
Then the game is over.*/



/*When the game is over, THEN you can save your initials and score into local storage.
Should we explore redirecting to a new HTML page? Or should we switch between divs that
dynamically change depending on the conditions... That way keeping only one HTML to worry about. */
